\section{Making Things Happen At the Click of a Finger}
\lstset{language=Python}

You need to make sure the glove is connected to the CodeBug which is in turn connected to the Raspberry Pi. Enter the
following code and run it. Then tap the copper strip on your forefinger against the copper strip on your thumb.

\noindent Using this code, lets us make different things happen when you tap different fingers on your thumb.

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Bronze Challenge:} Can you make it leave a much wider trail of blocks behind you if you tap one finger
  rather than the others.

\item\textbf{Silver Challenge:} Set one of the fingers to cause a cuboid 50x50x50 blocks in size of AIR to appear around
  you (this is useful when you need to ``delete'' some work).

\item\textbf{Gold Challenge:} Combine your code with some of the built in functions to make a series of things happen
  around you when you tap different fingers on your thumb. 

\item\textbf{Platinum Challenge:} What else can you do with this code?

\end{itemize}
