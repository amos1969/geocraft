\section{Make Blocks Appear at the Click of  Your Fingers}
\lstset{language=Python}

You need to make sure the glove is connected to the CodeBug which is in turn connected to the Raspberry Pi. Enter the
following code and run it. Then tap the copper strip on your forefinger against the cooper strip on your thumb.

\noindent% Line above MUST be blank
\tikzmark{Start}%
\lstinputlisting{codebug-part2.py}\vspace{0.2cm}
\tikzmark{End}
\AddBackgroundImage{Start}{End}{mosi}%
%

\noindent The code checks if the 0 Leg of the CodeBug has been connected to the GND Leg to form a circuit (which happens
when you tap the two bits of copper together). If they have, then the \lstinline{if} statement detects it and scrolls the
message.

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Bronze Challenge:} Combine the Minecraft code with this code to make a block of TNT appear under the
  player's feet (put the \lstinline{setBlock()} function inside the \lstinline{if} in place of the \lstinline{for}
  loop. 
\item\textbf{Silver Challenge:} Can you change the code to make other things happen when you tap the finger and thumb
  together?
\item\textbf{Gold Challenge:} Use some of the built in functions which are listed on the other sheet.
\end{itemize}

\section{Making Different Things Happen When Different Fingers Touch}

\noindent% Line above MUST be blank

\noindent Using this code lets us make different things happen when you tap different fingers on your thumb

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Bronze Challenge:} Can you make it leave a much wider trail of blocks behind you if you tap one finger
  rather than the others.

\item\textbf{Silver Challenge:} Set one of the fingers to cause a cuboid 50x50x50 blocks in size of AIR to appear around
  you (this is useful when you need to ``delete'' some work).

\item\textbf{Gold Challenge:} Combine your code with some of the built in functions to make a series of things happen
  around you when you tap different fingers on your thumb. 

\item\textbf{Platinum Challenge:} What else can you do with this code?

\end{itemize}
