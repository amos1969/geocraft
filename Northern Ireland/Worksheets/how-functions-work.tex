The code does lots of things, but mainly we have broken it down into logical sections (called functions) which we can
use anywhere in the code, as building blocks to make more complicated programs. Our example contains definitions for 3
functions called: \textbf{main, stacks} and \textbf{stacker}. \vspace{0.5cm}


The indented python after each use of the word \textbf{def} is called a \textbf{function definition}. It is where we
tell python what code to run when we see each function name.  \vspace{0.5cm}


When we run the program, it goes through the normal process of importing the libraries/modules we are using and then
establishes the connection to Minecraft as normal (\textbf{lines 1, 2, and 3}). Then we come to \textbf{line 5} which
contains the code  \textbf{def main():} this is the line which tell Python: here is a \textbf{def}inition for the
function called \textbf{main}, the brackets are also part of the definition (if we want to pass any values to the
function to use we do it in there) and the colon tells Python that the next lines will be indented and are going to
contain the \textbf{body} of our function. \vspace{0.5cm}


The \textbf{main} function contains code for a while loop which runs indefinitely, inside the loop we constantly get the
position of the player, create/update variables corresponding to the coordinates, and pass those current coordinates to
another function called \textbf{stacks}. When we first run the program, Python will see the function definition and the
body of the function but will \textbf{NOT} run any code at this point. Instead it notes down where to find the
definition for main, and what code to run when it is called. \vspace{0.5cm}

\newpage

Effectively what you are doing with a function definition is extending Python by creating your own commands, this one is
called \textbf{main} and to run it we would use \textbf{main()}. Which is the code which is found on the very last line
of the program. Python notes down where all 3 of the \textbf{function definitions} are and then reaches the final line
of the program which calls the \textbf{main} function and starts everything going. We have called it \textbf{main}
because it contains the main part of the program we want to run, it doesn't actually matter what the function is called
(we could just as easily name it Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luke, Leia, or Han) as long as we remeber when we get to the end
of the code what we called it and use that name to call it. Convention is to name it something relevant to the program
rather than a fictional name, though.  \vspace{0.5cm} 


When \textbf{main()} is called, the code inside the definition runs and at the end of each time through the loop (on
each iteration) the function called \textbf{stacks} is called, and is passed the three coordinates which we have
set. \textbf{Stacks} is another of our functions which we have defined. The \textbf{function definition} contains 4
lines of code, each of these lines is a call to another of our functions \textbf{stacker}, which we call each time with
slightly different versions of the coordinates.  \vspace{0.5cm}


When the function \textbf{stacker} is called the first time, we give it the coordinates of the player, with the
x-coordinate and the z-coordinate reduced by 3. The line of code inside \textbf{stacker} runs and creates a 5 block high
stack of blocks on these coordinates. Then without any extra code being added it automatically goes back to the point in
the code it was called from (it \textbf{returns}) and the next line of code is executed. This is again a call to the
\textbf{stacker} function with modified coordinates, it returns and the next line executes, until all 4 lines within the
\textbf{stacks} function have run.  \vspace{0.5cm}


At this point we have reached the end of the \textbf{stacks} function, so the code \textbf{returns} to where it was
called from (the last line of the while loop inside the main function. Since the last line of the loop has been reached,
the program then checks whether we can run the loop again (because it says \textbf{True} it will always run) and
restarts the loop. The code in the loop then gets the player's current position again, sets the variables for the
coordinates and calls the \textbf{stacks} function with our new values.  \vspace{0.5cm}


This process will repeat for ever until we tell Python that we want the loop to exit (hold the control key down and
press c in the Python Shell) or we run a new Python program, which will restart the Shell.  \vspace{0.5cm}
